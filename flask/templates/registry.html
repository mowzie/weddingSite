<div style="text-align: center;">
  Some of you are traveling across the states to celebrate with us in Minneapolis,
  so your presence means the world to us and is all we ask for.
  Especially during this time of Covid that has affected many of us.<br>
  If you'd still like to contribute to our registry or honeymoon funds, please use the link below.
  <p>
  <p>I should note: We ARE interested in Charleston, but we haven't finished out this registry site yet due to busy
    schedules</p>
  <p>So if you read things like "the bride likes fishing" - its because we haven't had time to go in there and change it
    up yet :D</p>
